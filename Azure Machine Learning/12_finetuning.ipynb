    "# Fine-tune a foundation model with Azure Machine Learning\n",
    "Foundation models are pre-trained models that provide you with a great starting point. By using a foundation model, you can save time and effort as you need less data to train a model for your specific machine learning use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a data scientist working for a hotel booking agency. When customers browse through different hotels, one of the most important factors in deciding which hotel to book is reviews from other travelers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist, you may want to extract insights from the hotel reviews to find out why certain hotels are preferred over others. To extract information from hotel reviews, you can use Large Language Models (LLMs) that are designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs leverage deep learning techniques to understand and generate human language. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks with multiple layers to extract hierarchical patterns and representations from data. Training neural networks can be costly as it requires high volumes of data and powerful compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of training your own LLM from scratch, you can use a pretrained model that you fine-tune using your own data. Imagine you want to detect sentiment in hotel reviews. You may want to categorize any newly posted reviews as describing the hotel as terrible, average, or excellent. You can use a small set of categorized hotel reviews to fine-tune a pretrained foundation model.\n"

    "# Understand when to fine-tune a foundation model\n",
    "By using open-source pretrained foundation models, you can save resources. Sometimes, you may need to fine-tune a foundation model to cater to your specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explore foundation models in the model catalog\n",
    "Foundation models are large machine learning models that are already trained to serve as the base for a wide variety of use cases.\n",
    "In Azure Machine Learning, you can explore open source foundation models by searching through the model catalog. What type of foundation model you need depends on what you want to use the model for.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, foundation models are trained on large amounts of data and excel at doing generic tasks like understanding language, generating text, and predicting context. However, they might not be the best choice if you need a model tailored to a specific task or domain. In such cases, fine-tuning the foundation model on task-specific data can help meet your specific requirements and achieve better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fine-tuning foundation models for specific tasks\n",
    "Though the foundation models may already satisfy your requirements, it may be necessary for you to fine-tune a foundation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foundation models are pretrained on a diverse range of text from the internet, making them proficient in general language understanding. However, fine-tuning allows you to tailor the model's knowledge to a specific task or domain, optimizing its performance and ensuring it excels in that particular context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common tasks for which you may want to fine-tune a foundation model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text classification: Categorizing a given text into predefined classes or categories based on its content or context.\n",
    "- Token classification: Assigning specific labels or tags to individual tokens or words in a text, often used in tasks like named entity recognition.\n",
    "- Question answering: Providing accurate and relevant answers to questions posed in natural language.\n",
    "- Summarization: Creating concise and coherent summaries of longer texts, capturing the essential information.\n",
    "- Translation: Converting text from one language to another while preserving the meaning and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "As foundation models are already pretrained, you need a smaller task-specific dataset to fine-tune a foundation model. When you fine-tune a model, you're likely to need less data and compute than when you would train a model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can fine-tune a foundation model from the model catalog in Azure Machine Learning. You only need a small dataset and a GPU cluster to fine-tune a model.\n"

    "You can filter the available models based on the task you want to fine-tune a model for. Per task, you have several options for foundation models to choose from. When deciding between foundation models for a task, you can examine the description of the model, and the referenced model card.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some considerations you may take into account when deciding on a foundation model before fine-tuning are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model capabilities: Evaluate the capabilities of the foundation model and how well they align with your task. For example, a model like BERT is better at understanding short texts.\n",
    "- Pretraining data: Consider the dataset used for pretraining the foundation model. For example, GPT-2 is trained on unfiltered content from the internet that may result in biases.\n",
    "- Limitations and biases: Be aware of any limitations or biases that might be present in the foundation model.\n",
    "- Language support: Explore which models offer the specific language support or multilingual capabilities that you need for your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Though the Azure Machine Learning studio provides you with descriptions for each foundation model in the model catalog, you can also find more information about each model through the respective model card.
